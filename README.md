## Tech Stack

The webapp is powered by: 
 - **NextJS13** (_appdir/_ enabled) for SSR, ISR and other features that come built-in,
 - **Redux Toolkit** and **React-Redux** bindings for better state-management,
 - **PeerJS** for **WebRTC** and serverless communication (videocall and chatting),
 - **Typescript** for its type safety.
